Description:  
The market growth for cosmetics is vastly growing. We want to take a closer look at the top-competing brands and compare their ingredients with those known to the EPA to be toxic. As well as, if their average ratings coincide with the negative effects on the body.

Research Questions: 
Which products have the most toxic chemicals known to the EPA?
What ingredients are linked to cancer, and which brands have the most products with those ingredients?
Do products with lower ratings coincide with products that contain the toxic chemicals?
Is there a relationship between product ratings and the price?
What is the relationship among the product ingredients (toxic?)  and what type of skin works best with those products?
