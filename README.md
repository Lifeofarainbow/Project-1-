Description:  
The cosmetic industry is a large part of the U.S. economy and a huge part of our lives. We want to take a closer look at the top-competing brands, products, and chemicals included in the cosmetics industry. Based on ratings, pricing, ingredients, brand information,  and cosmetic retailers; what are common trends that we can gather from our research?

Research Questions: 
What brands contain the most toxic chemicals out of the selected brands, and how much do they differ in amounts of toxic products?
What are the top common toxic chemicals included in the ingredients of cosmetic products?
Ulta vs. Sephora: Do they share any price trends?
What are the most popular cosmetic products?
Are there any notable differences in the attributes (price, ingredients) of the top 10 most popular products from different brands?
