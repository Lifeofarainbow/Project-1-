Description:  
The cosmetic industry is a large part of the U.S. economy and a huge part of our lives. We want to take a closer look at the top-competing brands, products, and chemicals included in the cosmetics industry. Based on ratings, pricing, ingredients, brand information,  and cosmetic retailers; what are common trends that we can gather from our research?

Final Analysis:
Out of the top 5 brands previously mentioned, the top 3 had similar product counts and out of the extensive list of common toxic chemicals, Titanium Dioxide was by far the most used. When comparing sales between Sephora and Ulta, it is clear that Ulta has on average, the cheaper, more affordable products, by a difference of at least $40. Out of the brands, La Mer had on average the most expensive pricing, at an average total of $184. And the most common ingredients used were extracts.

Research Questions: 
What brands contain the most toxic chemicals out of the selected brands, and how much do they differ in amounts of toxic products?
What are the top common toxic chemicals included in the ingredients of cosmetic products?
Ulta vs. Sephora: Do they share any price trends?
What are the most popular cosmetic products?
Are there any notable differences in the attributes (price, ingredients) of the top 10 most popular products from different brands?

When comparing Ulta with sephora do they share any of the same price trends?

Analysis:
When comparing Ulta’s skincare products to Sephora’s products there were some notable price similarities. When looking at the histogram of each they are both right skewed so their price average is greater than their median price. They both only have one peak so one mode. Sephora’s average was 3 times that of Ulta’s at $63 compared to Ulta’s $21. Sephora had a greater price range with a max of $495 compared to Ulta’s max of $85 showing that Ulta is clearly more affordable than Sephora.
Since there was such a greater spread in price when comparing the two retailers, I wanted to know would there be a correlation of price to ratings to justify Sephora’s higher price range? When looking at the data Sephora had no correlation of price and ratings, and Ulta had a moderate correlation of the two. Sephora had a correlation of .07 and Ulta had a correlation of .32, which again is only a moderate significance.
Ulta carries a wider variety of products which may be why they are able to price differently than Sephora. When looking at the ratings it does not justify the greater price in skincare products at Sephora. In conclusion, when it comes to value Ulta clearly beats Sephora.
