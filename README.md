Description:  
The market growth for cosmetics is vastly growing. We want to look at who the top competing brands are, and what key insights they might have.

Research Questions: 
Do cosmetics sell better, when reviews on average are higher? 
Do cosmetics sell more online, or in-store? 
Where do cosmetics sell best and what are the demographics of those areas? 
What are the differences in brand-name and generic ingredients? 
Which products have the most toxic chemicals? 
What ingredients are linked to cancer?
What brands have carcinogens as ingredients?
